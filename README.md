D3.js project for the course Information Visualisation

## Assignment

Draw some leaves all over the canvas, like if their floating on the top of a water surface. The leaves are draggable and under one of them there is a fish. When the user moves the leaf over the fish, the fish moves under 3 leaves in sequence and then hides under the last one. The sequence of leaves are loaded from a JSON file (5 sequences in loop).
